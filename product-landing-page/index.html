                The goal of the project is to design, test and refine a compact, low-cost, oscillatory-flow pump that
                will reproduce realistic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow conditions within a given range of human/animal
                cerebrospinal models. Flow rates mimic cardiac and respiratory frequencies and have an adjustable
                frequency and flow volume.

                <h2 id="CSF">What is CSF?</h2>

                CSF Central nervous system (CNS) diseases can be difficult to treat because many potential drugs cannot
                reach the brain due to the blood brain barrier. A potential new route to get drugs to the brain is to
                inject them into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). One way to bypass the blood brain barrier is by direct
                injection of drugs to the CSF. Drugs can then spread/mix in the CSF and be distributed directly to the
                brain and spinal cord tissue surface.

                The CSF is a clear water-like fluid located around the entire brain and spinal cord and pulses each time
                the heart beats thereby making it a good medium to transport drugs to the CNS. One problem with
                delivering drugs to the CNS by the CSF is that it requires extremely expensive (and ethically nebulous)
                animal studies to understand and optimize the delivery device and protocol. Thus, the NIML is designing
                the world's first laboratory bench-top simulator of the complete CSF system for brain therapeutic
                development. They have an ongoing project to make a detailed in vitro model that accurately represents
                the CSF anatomy and flow that would accommodate testing with medical devices. The Cerebrospinal Fluid
                Pump project is designed to pair with the NIML's existing human spinal model to make a complete CSF
                system simulation.

                <h2 id="flow">Oscillatory Flow</h2>


                By definition flow of fluid, gas, or electricity moves along or out steadily and continuously in a
                current or stream and oscillation is the repetitive variation, typically in time, of some measure about
                an equilibrium. Together, oscillatory flow is the variation of a wave frequency in time.

                The oscillatory waveform chosen to mimic the same frequency of a heat beat takes the form of a
                sinusoidal wave. Typically, a resting healthy human heat beat can range anywhere from 60 to 100 beats
                per minute (bpm). The use of fluid dynamics can assist in predicting the behaviors of flow in a pump in
                multiple ways. With a known frequency or speed of a fluid, displacement or stroke volume, and the area
                of the cylinder that the fluid is passing though, then the continuity equation can be used as a way to
                model fluid flow. Another basic equation that can be used to predict other aspects of fluid flow such as
                pressure is Bernoulli’s Equation.
                <h2 id="syringe">Syringe Travel Force</h2>

                Time and force required for a manual injection (or time required for an injection using an autoinjector)
                are important and may impact the usability of the product by the end-user and thus compliance. The force
                required for the injection of a solution at a given injection rate via a needle of predetermined gauge
                and length is referred to as ‘syringeability’ [2]. The Hagen-Poiseuille equation can be utilized to
                estimate the travel (or glide) force (Equation 1).
